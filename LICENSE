Addendum

By using this code, you agree to:

- Blame all bugs on cosmic rays, quantum fluctuations, or the phase of the moon.
- Credit the author for all segfaults, but none of the working features.
- Never ask “Why C?” in a job interview (or at family dinners).
- Remember: If it compiles, ship it. If it doesn’t, blame the makefile.
- If you actually read this license, treat yourself to a coffee - you’ve earned it.
